A zonal analysis system was used to document osseous changes in the femur and the acetabulum. Acetabular cup and femoral stem subsidence and migration, femoral canal fill, and implant orientation were measured. Survival analysis of the procedure was conducted.Long-term follow-up was available for 37 dogs (46 prostheses). The median follow-up was 63 months. Limb function was normal for 37 limbs and abnormal for 9 limbs because of dislocation (n = 3), lumbosacral disease (n = 2), degenerative myelopathy (n = 1), autoimmune disease (n = 1), brain tumor (n = 1), or osteosarcoma of the femur (n = 1). All prosthetic stems and cups were fixed by bone ingrowth fixation. Osteolysis was not observed. Bone infarction occurred in five femoral canals (four dogs). The 6-year survival rate for the procedure was 87% (95% confidence interval, 72%-96%).Long-term fixation of the uncemented PCA acetabular cup and stem is successful in dogs, and long-term clinical function is excellent.","language":"eng","subjects":[{"value":"Animals","meshId":"D000818","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip","meshId":"D019644","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Dogs","meshId":"D004285","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Follow-Up Studies","meshId":"D005500","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Hip Joint","meshId":"D006621","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Hip Prosthesis","meshId":"D006622","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Osseointegration","meshId":"D016348","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Prospective Studies","meshId":"D011446","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Radiography","meshId":"D011859","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Survival Analysis","meshId":"D016019","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Treatment Outcome","meshId":"D016896","registryNumber":null}],"publicationTypes":[{"value":"Clinical Trial","meshId":"D016428","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","meshId":"D013485","registryNumber":null}],"grants":[],"authors":[{"lastName":"Marcellin-Little","foreName":"D J","fullName":"D J, Marcellin-Little"},{"lastName":"DeYoung","foreName":"B A","fullName":"B A, DeYoung"},{"lastName":"Doyens","foreName":"D H","fullName":"D H, Doyens"},{"lastName":"DeYoung","foreName":"D J","fullName":"D J, DeYoung"}]}

Peanut agglutinin (PNA) lectin histochemistry, which detects D-galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine sugars, was conducted in incisor odontoblasts of ovariectomized (OVX) and sham-operated (sham) rats. At 5 wk after the operation, bone mineral density and serum level of estrogen in OVX rats were lower than those in sham rats. PNA binding sites were found in the odontoblasts in incisors, and the binding sites in OVX rats were much stronger than those in sham rats. Furthermore, PNA binding sites were localized at the predentin matrix in OVX rats, but the reaction in sham rats was not detected. Because D-galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine sugars bound to PNA are important constituents of proteoglycans in dentin matrix and the PNA binding sites reflect the proteoglycan production of odontoblasts, these results indicated that galactosyl glycosylation of proteoglycans in odontoblasts is influenced by estrogen deficiency in rat incisors.","language":"eng","subjects":[{"value":"Acetylgalactosamine","meshId":"D000116","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Animals","meshId":"D000818","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Binding Sites","meshId":"D001665","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Estrogens","meshId":"D004967","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Female","meshId":"D005260","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Galactose","meshId":"D005690","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Glycosylation","meshId":"D006031","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Incisor","meshId":"D007180","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Odontoblasts","meshId":"D009804","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Ovariectomy","meshId":"D010052","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Peanut Agglutinin","meshId":"D019887","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Proteoglycans","meshId":"D011509","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Rats","meshId":"D051381","registryNumber":null},{"value":"Rats, Sprague-Dawley","meshId":"D017207","registryNumber":null}],"publicationTypes":[{"value":"Clinical Trial","meshId":"D013485","registryNumber":null}],"grants":[],"authors":[{"lastName":"Yokose","foreName":"S","fullName":"S, Yokose"},{"lastName":"Zhungfeng","foreName":"C","fullName":"C, Zhungfeng"},{"lastName":"Tajima","foreName":"Y","fullName":"Y, Tajima"},{"lastName":"Fujieda","foreName":"K","fullName":"K, Fujieda"},{"lastName":"Katayama","foreName":"I","fullName":"I, Katayama"},{"lastName":"Katayama","foreName":"T","fullName":"T, Katayama"}]}
