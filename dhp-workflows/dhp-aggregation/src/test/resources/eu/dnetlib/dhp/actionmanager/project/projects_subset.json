In manned aviation, the methods of determining the altitude of an aircraft are based on pressure altitude difference measurements (e.g. QFE, QNH and FL) referred to a common datum. \nThe UA flights superimpose a new challenge, since a small drone may take off and land almost from everywhere, hence reducing the original significance of QFE settings, introduced on behalf of manned pilots to display on the altimeter the 0-height at touchdown on the local runway. In fact, the possibility for n drones to take off at n different places would generate a series of n different QFE corresponding to different heights of ground pressures referred to the take-off “Home points”. Therefore for a large number drones, new methodologies and procedures shall be put in place. The ICARUS defines a new U-space U3 service tightly coupled with the interface of the existing U-space services (e.g. Tracking, and Flight Planning services). The users of ICARUS service shall be remote pilots competent to fly in BVLOS in the specific category of UAS operations and ultralight GA pilots potentially sharing the same VLL airspace. \nThe ICARUS proposed approach foresees the realization of DTM service embedded in an Application Program Interface (API) that can be queried by UAS pilot/operator (or by drone itself) based on the actual positioning of the UA along its trajectory, computed by the (E)GNSS receiver. The output of the DTM service would provide information on distance from ground/obstacles in combination with the common altitude reference.\nAccuracy, continuity, integrity and availability requirements for GNSS-based altimetry together with accuracy and resolution requirements of the DTM to be provided by ICARUS service are key topics of the study.","totalCost":"1385286,25","ecMaxContribution":"1144587,5","call":"H2020-SESAR-2019-2","fundingScheme":"SESAR-RIA","coordinator":"E-GEOS SPA","coordinatorCountry":"IT","participants":"TOPVIEW SRL;TELESPAZIO SPA;DRONERADAR SP Z O.O.;EUROCONTROL - EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR THE SAFETY OF AIR NAVIGATION;EUROUSC ESPANA SL;POLITECNICO DI MILANO;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI ROMA LA SAPIENZA","participantCountries":"IT;PL;BE;ES","subjects":""}

The need for upgrading the existing old and CHB is becoming increasingly important for the EU countries, due to: (1) their poor structural performance during recent earthquakes (e.g. Italy, Greece) or other natural hazards (e.g. extreme weather conditions) that have resulted in significant economic losses, and loss of human lives; and (2) their low energy performance which increases significantly their energy consumption (buildings are responsible for 40% of EU energy consumption). Moreover, the SHM of the existing buildings is crucial for assessing continuously their structural integrity and thus to provide information for planning cost effective and sustainable maintenance decisions. Since replacing the old buildings with new is not financially feasible, and even it is not allowed for CHB, their lifetime extension requires considering simultaneously both structural and energy retrofitting. It is noted that the annual cost of repair and maintenance of existing European building stock is estimated to be about 50% of the total construction budget, currently standing at more than €300 billion. To achieve cost effectiveness, STRETCH explores a novel approach, which integrates technical textile reinforcement with thermal insulation systems and strain sensors to provide simultaneous structural-plus-energy retrofitting combined with SHM, tailored for masonry cultural heritage building envelopes.

When we listen to foreign languages, we may perceive them to be more musical, or rather more rap-like than our own. Even if we are unaware of it, the rhythm and melody of language, i.e. prosody, reflects its linguistic structure. On the one hand, prosody emphasizes content words and new information with stress and accents. On the other hand, it is aligned to phrase edges, marking them with boundary tones. Prosody hence helps the listener to focus on important words and to chunk sentences into phrases, and phrases into words. In fact, prosody is even used predictively, for instance to time the onset of the next word, the next piece of new information, or the total remaining length of the utterance, so the listener can seamlessly start their own speaking turn. \nSo, the listener, or rather their brain, is actively predicting when important speech events will happen, using prosody. How prosodic rhythms are exploited to predict speech timing, however, is unclear. No link between prosody and neural predictive processing has yet been empirically made. One hypothesis is that rhythm, such as the alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables, helps listeners time their attention. Similar behavior is best captured by the notion of an internal oscillator which can be set straight by attentional spikes. While neuroscientific evidence for the relation of neural oscillators to speech processing is starting to emerge, no link to the use of prosody nor predictive listening exists, yet. Furthermore, it is still unknown how native language knowledge affects cortical oscillations, and how oscillations are affected by cross-linguistic differences in rhythmic structure. The current project combines the standing knowledge of prosodic typology with the recent advances in neuroscience on cortical oscillations, to investigate the role of internal oscillators on native prosody perception, and active speech prediction.","totalCost":"191149,44","ecMaxContribution":"191149,44","call":"H2020-MSCA-IF-2019","fundingScheme":"MSCA-IF-EF-ST","coordinator":"UNIVERSITE DE GENEVE","coordinatorCountry":"CH","participants":"","participantCountries":"","subjects":""}

Recycling and self-healing processes will replace fossil fuel dependent technology. Self-healing will involve rejuvenating aged asphalt bitumen using a bio-rejuvenator developed using microalgae oils (rejuvenating bio-oil). Microalgae has been selected because of its fast growth, versatility and ability to survive within hostile environments, such as wastewater.  \n\nASAP will utilise microalgae, cultivated within the wastewater treatment process, as a source of the rejuvenating bio-oil. The solvent (Soxhlet) processes will be used to extract the oil from the microalgae. To ensure the efficiency of the oil extraction process, an ultrasonication process will be used to pre-treat the microalgae. The suitability of rejuvenating bio-oil as a replacement for the bitumen rejuvenator (fossil fuel based) will be ascertained via a series of standard bituminous and accelerated tests. A rejuvenator-binder diffusion numerical model will be developed, based on the Delft Lattice concrete diffusion model, to determine the conditions required for rejuvenation to occur and to ascertain the healing rate of the asphalt binder.

However, since finding mechanistic interpretations relating genotype to phenotype has proven challenging, the focus has shifted to higher-order regulatory features, i.e. chromatin accessibility, transcription factor (TF) binding and 3D chromatin interactions. This revealed at least two enhancer types: “lead” enhancers in which the presence of genetic variants modulates the activity of entire chromatin domains, and “dependent” ones in which variants induce subtle changes, affecting DNA accessibility, but not transcription. Although cell type-specific TFs are likely important, it remains unclear which sequence features are required to establish such enhancer hierarchies, and under which circumstances genetic variation results in altered enhancer-promoter contacts and differential gene expression.  Here, we propose to investigate the molecular mechanisms that link DNA variation to TF binding, chromatin topology, and gene expression response. We will leverage data on enhancer hierarchy and sequence-specific TF binding to identify the sequence signatures that define “lead” enhancers. The results will guide the design of a synthetic locus that serves as an in vivo platform to systematically vary the building blocks of local transcriptional units: i) DNA sequence – including variations in TF binding site affinity and syntax, ii) molecular interactions between TFs, and iii) chromatin conformation. To validate our findings, we will perform optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture for a select number of DNA variants.

Developmental progression requires the synthesis of new mRNAs and proteins in a coordinated fashion. Many posttranscriptional mechanisms regulate the fate of maternal mRNAs, but it is less understood how translational control shapes early embryogenesis. In eukaryotes, translation starts at the mRNA 5′ end, consisting of the 5′ cap and 5′ untranslated region (UTR). Protein synthesis is primarily regulated at the translation initiation step by elements within the 5′UTR. However, the role of 5′UTRs in regulating the dynamics of mRNA translation during vertebrate embryogenesis remains unexplored. For example, all vertebrate ribosomal protein (RP) mRNAs harbor a conserved terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP) in their 5′UTR. RP levels must be tightly controlled to ensure proper organismal development, but if and how the TOP motif mediates RP mRNA translational regulation during embryogenesis is unclear. Overall, we lack a systematic understanding of the regulatory information contained in 5′UTRs. In this work, I aim to uncover the 5′UTR in vivo rules for mRNA translational regulation during zebrafish embryogenesis. I propose to apply imaging and biochemical approaches to characterise the role of the TOP motif in RP mRNA translational regulation during embryogenesis and identify the trans-acting factor(s) that bind(s) to it (Aim 1). To systematically assess the contribution of 5′UTRs to mRNA translational regulation during zebrafish embryogenesis, I will couple a massively parallel reporter assay of 5′UTRs to polysome profiling (Aim 2).

By building on field-based methodologies (interviews and participant observations), DoMiCoP sheds ethnographic light on the role that ‘learning from abroad’ plays in the implementation of migration control in the EU. My project’s aim is threefold: 1) Identifying arenas at intermediate levels in which communities of practice take shape; 2) Analysing the communities of practice by focusing on the configurations of actors and organizations involved, the motivations underlying their involvement, the process of knowledge development in interaction, the conflicts and negotiations; 3) Revealing the role of non-state organizations (private for profit and not-for-profit). From a theoretical point of view, this project goes beyond the classical view of the implementation as a test to assess the effectiveness of policy transfers towards an analysis of policy transfer at that level of policy-making. From an empirical point of view, the project expands knowledge about less-studied venues of policy-making and provides original thick descriptions. From a methodological point of view, the project engages with qualitative methods for the study of policy diffusion and aims at responding to their main challenges through participant observation.","totalCost":"163673,28","ecMaxContribution":"163673,28","call":"H2020-MSCA-IF-2019","fundingScheme":"MSCA-IF-EF-ST","coordinator":"EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE","coordinatorCountry":"IT","participants":"","participantCountries":"","subjects":""}

Protein phosphorylation (PP) has recently emerged as one of the major post-translational modification in bacteria, involved in the regulation of multiple physiological processes. In this MSCA individual fellowship application we aim to bridge the current gap in the field for prokaryotes by unravelling the unknown regulatory role of PP on proteins involved in nitrosative stress (NS) detoxification in the model bacterium E.coli. We propose to examine for the first time both global protein modifications (e.g. phosphoproteomics) under nitrogen species stress, as well as characterize PP in individual proteins involved in NS response. We will construct a network model that reflect the phosphoproteomic changes upon NS in E.coli, that may pave the way for the design of new bacterial targets. Understanding how bacteria respond to the chemical weapons of the human innate system is fundamental to develop efficient therapies. We will pioneer research on the mechanism and the regulation of nitric oxide detoxification proteins already identified as phosphorylated, by analyzing how this modification influences their stability and activity in vitro and in vivo. This project opens up new research paths on bacterial detoxification systems and signalling in general, addressing for the first time the role of PP in these processes. The proposal brings together transversal and scientific skills that will enable the researcher to lead the development of this emerging field and position herself as an expert in the area, and aims at establishing the importance of PP in NO microbial response, a novelty in this field.","totalCost":"147815,04","ecMaxContribution":"147815,04","call":"H2020-WF-02-2019","fundingScheme":"MSCA-IF-EF-ST","coordinator":"UNIVERSIDADE NOVA DE LISBOA","coordinatorCountry":"PT","participants":"","participantCountries":"","subjects":""}
