Previous threshold-derivation studies have been limited by uncertainties introduced by infarct expansion between the acute phase of stroke and follow-up imaging, or DWI lesion reversibility. In this study a model is proposed for determining infarction CBF thresholds at 3hr ischemia time by comparing contemporaneously acquired CTP derived CBF maps to 18F-FFMZ-PET imaging, with the objective of deriving a CBF threshold for infarction after 3 hours of ischemia. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) was injected into the brain of Duroc-Cross pigs (n = 11) through a burr hole in the skull. CTP images were acquired 10 and 30 minutes post ET-1 injection and then every 30 minutes for 150 minutes. 370 MBq of 18F-FFMZ was injected ~120 minutes post ET-1 injection and PET images were acquired for 25 minutes starting ~155-180 minutes post ET-1 injection. CBF maps from each CTP acquisition were co-registered and converted into a median CBF map. The median CBF map was co-registered to blood volume maps for vessel exclusion, an average CT image for grey/white matter segmentation, and 18F-FFMZ-PET images for infarct delineation. Logistic regression and ROC analysis were performed on infarcted and non-infarcted pixel CBF values for each animal that developed infarct. Six of the eleven animals developed infarction. The mean CBF value corresponding to the optimal operating point of the ROC curves for the 6 animals was 12.6 ± 2.8 mL·min-1·100g-1 for infarction after 3 hours of ischemia. The porcine ET-1 model of cerebral ischemia is easier to implement then other large animal models of stroke, and performs similarly as long as CBF is monitored using CTP to prevent reperfusion."],"format":[],"id":"50|dedup_wf_001::0017bb7bb6a0e2f5624db2721a1bc1a5","instance":[{"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown

Additionally, organisms such as soil microbes belowground or parasitoids that develop inside their herbivorous hosts aboveground, can change plant responses to herbivory. However, it is not yet well known how organisms of trophic levels other than herbivores, below- and above-ground, alter the interactions between insect species sharing a host plant. Here, we investigated whether the parasitoid Aphidius colemani and different soil microbial communities (created through plant-soil feedbacks) affect the JA and SA signalling pathways in response to the aphid Myzus persicae and the thrips Frankliniella occidentalis, as well as subsequent thrips performance. Our results show that the expression of the JA-responsive gene CaPINII in sweet pepper was more suppressed by aphids than by parasitised aphids. However, parasitism did not affect the expression of CaPAL1, a biosynthetic gene of SA. Furthermore, aphid feeding enhanced thrips performance compared with uninfested plants, but this was not observed when aphids were parasitised. Soils where different plant species were previously grown, did not affect plant responses or the interaction between herbivores. Our study shows that members of the third trophic level can modify herbivore interactions by altering plant physiology.\nThis work and T.V.’s activities were supported by Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, (CGL2016-79054), the Open Technology Program of NWO (TTW-13848), and the STSM Cost Action FA1405 funded by the European Union.

Evidence from linguistics and archaeology indicates that the ‘Austronesian expansion,’ which began 4,000–5,000 years ago, likely had roots in Taiwan, but the ancestry of present-day Austronesian-speaking populations remains controversial. Here, we analyse genome-wide data from 56 populations using new methods for tracing ancestral gene flow, focusing primarily on Island Southeast Asia. We show that all sampled Austronesian groups harbour ancestry that is more closely related to aboriginal Taiwanese than to any present-day mainland population. Surprisingly, western Island Southeast Asian populations have also inherited ancestry from a source nested within the variation of present-day populations speaking Austro-Asiatic languages, which have historically been nearly exclusive to the mainland. Thus, either there was once a substantial Austro-Asiatic presence in Island Southeast Asia, or Austronesian speakers migrated to and through the mainland, admixing there before continuing to western Indonesia.","National Science Foundation (U.S.).

In this paper the first results from the proton–lead collision data taken in early 2013 are presented. The Z boson production cross section is measured in the muon decay channel in bins of transverse momentum and rapidity together with the forward–backward ratio. The W production is studied in the muon and electron decay channels and the differential cross sections, lepton-charge and forward–backward asymmetries are computed as a function of the lepton pseudorapidity. All results are compared with theory predictions with and without nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions showing hints of nuclear effects."],"format":[],"id":"50|dedup_wf_001::02cb7e7397a1f775e53ed38b38aba680","instance":[{"accessright":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::666894f04637d4dd1861ad117e1c4a66","value":"SNSF P3 Database"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"publicationdate":"2014-01-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","type":"Conference object","url":["http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2014.07.039"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|opendoar____::fc490ca45c00b1249bbe3554a4fdf6fb","value":"CERN Document Server"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|opendoar____::fc490ca45c00b1249bbe3554a4fdf6fb","value":"CERN Document Server"},"publicationdate":"2014-07-01","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Other literature type","url":["http://cds.cern.ch/record/1746343"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_16ec","label":"RESTRICTED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|issn___print::430d7bc82c281348c595f0aba4ad70f2","value":"Nuclear Physics A"},"license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","publicationdate":"2014-08-04T16:17:22Z","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Article","url":["https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0375947414002401?httpAccept=text/xml","https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0375947414002401?httpAccept=text/plain","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2014.07.039"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|issn___print::430d7bc82c281348c595f0aba4ad70f2","value":"Nuclear Physics A"},"refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Article","url":["http://cds.cern.ch/record/1746343/files/CR2014_136.pdf"]},{"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|issn___print::430d7bc82c281348c595f0aba4ad70f2","value":"Nuclear Physics A"},"refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Article","url":["https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014NuPhA.931..718Z/abstract","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375947414002401","https://academic.microsoft.com/#/detail/2009363498"]}],"language":{"code":"UNKNOWN","label":"UNKNOWN"},"lastupdatetimestamp":1603727328518,"maintitle":"Z and W boson production in pPb collisions with CMS","originalId":["","oai:cds.cern.ch:1746343","S0375947414002401","10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2014.07.039","2009363498"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"doi:10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2014.07.039"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2014.07.039"}],"projects":[{"code":"IZ73Z0_152601","funder":{"fundingStream":"Programmes","jurisdiction":"CH","name":"Swiss National Science Foundation","shortName":"SNSF"},"id":"40|snsf________::549ac0283d2cd3c4ef08792680f8c8c2","provenance":{"provenance":"Harvested","trust":"0.900000000000000022"},"title":"Preparation for and exploitation of the CMS data taking at the next LHC run"}],"publicationdate":"2014-07-01","publisher":"Elsevier,Netherlands","subjects":[{"provenance":{"provenance":"Harvested","trust":"0.9"},"subject":{"scheme":"keyword","value":"Detectors and Experimental Techniques"}},{"subject":{"scheme":"keywords","value":"Nuclear and High Energy Physics"}},{"provenance":{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8784"},"subject":{"scheme":"arxiv","value":"High Energy Physics::Experiment"}},{"provenance":{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8694"},"subject":{"scheme":"arxiv","value":"Nuclear Experiment"}},{"provenance":{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.7965"},"subject":{"scheme":"arxiv","value":"High Energy Physics::Phenomenology"}}],"type":"publication"}

Due to the portability and relative inexpensiveness of electroencephalography, the N400 event-related potential component has been proposed as a clinically valid means to identify preserved linguistic function in non-communicative patients. Across three experiments, we show that changes in both stimuli and task demands significantly influence the probability of detecting statistically significant N400 effects — that is, the difference in N400 amplitudes caused by the experimental manipulation. In terms of task demands, passively heard linguistic stimuli were significantly less likely to elicit N400 effects than task-relevant stimuli. Due to the inability of the majority of patients with disorders of consciousness to follow task commands, the insensitivity of passive listening would impede the identification of residual language abilities even when such abilities exist. In terms of stimuli, passively heard normatively associated word pairs produced the highest detection rate of N400 effects (50% of the participants), compared with semantically-similar word pairs (0%) and high-cloze sentences (17%). This result is consistent with a prediction error account of N400 magnitude, with highly predictable targets leading to smaller N400 waves, and therefore larger N400 effects. Overall, our data indicate that non-repeating normatively associated word pairs provide the highest probability of detecting single-subject N400s during passive listening, and may thereby provide a clinically viable means of assessing residual linguistic function. We also show that more liberal analyses may further increase the detection-rate, but at the potential cost of increased false alarms.","Highlights • The N400 is a candidate marker of linguistic function after severe brain injury. • The probability of detecting N400s is dependent on task demands. • Passive listening is less sensitive than command-following. • The probability of detecting N400s is dependent on stimuli choices. • Word-pairs generated from association norms provide the highest sensitivity."],"format":["application/pdf"],"id":"50|dedup_wf_001::03d1b1b04480058e646b34c174e61082","instance":[{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|doajarticles::0c0e74daa5d95504eade9c81ebbd5b8a","value":"NeuroImage:

The validity and utility of standard measures of childhood maltreatment requires clarification in order to inform the design of future studies investigating the mental health consequences of maltreatment. The present study assessed agreement between prospective informant-reports and retrospective self-reports of childhood maltreatment, as well as the comparative utility of both reports for predicting a range of psychiatric problems at age 18. Data were obtained from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally-representative birth cohort of 2232 children followed to 18 years of age (with 93% retention). Childhood maltreatment was assessed in two ways: (i) prospective informant-reports from caregivers, researchers, and clinicians when children were aged 5, 7, 10 and 12; and (ii) retrospective self-reports of maltreatment experiences occurring up to age 12, obtained at age 18 using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Participants were privately interviewed at age 18 concerning several psychiatric problems including depression, anxiety, self-injury, alcohol/cannabis dependence, and conduct disorder. There was only slight to fair agreement between prospective and retrospective reports of childhood maltreatment (all Kappa's ≤ 0.31). Both prospective and retrospective reports of maltreatment were associated with age-18 psychiatric problems, though the strongest associations were found when maltreatment was retrospectively self-reported. These findings indicate that prospective and retrospective reports of childhood maltreatment capture largely non-overlapping groups of individuals. Young adults who recall being maltreated have a particularly elevated risk for psychopathology."],"format":["application/pdf","text"],"id":"50|dedup_wf_001::085f9efc74e1192abca87031fb573d70","instance":[{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|opendoar____::566a9968b43628588e76be5a85a0f9e8","value":"King's

Here, we focused on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), testing the hypothesis that plants grown on native soils display different responses to soil microbiotas.\r\nUsing transcriptomics, proteomics, and biochemistry, we describe the responses of two tomato genotypes (susceptible or resistant to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici) grown on an artificial growth substrate and two native soils (conducive and suppressive to Fusarium).\r\nNative soils affected tomato responses by modulating pathways involved in responses to oxidative stress, phenol biosynthesis, lignin deposition, and innate immunity, particularly in the suppressive soil. In tomato plants grown on steam-disinfected soils, total phenols and lignin decreased significantly. The inoculation of a mycorrhizal fungus partly rescued this response locally and systemically. Plants inoculated with the fungal pathogen showed reduced disease symptoms in the resistant genotype in both soils, but the susceptible genotype was partially protected from the pathogen only when grown on the suppressive soil.\r\nThe ‘state of alert’ detected in tomatoes reveals novel mechanisms operating in plants in native soils and the soil microbiota appears to be one of the drivers of these plant responses."],"format":[],"id":"50|dedup_wf_001::09e54cbad6670d8f40a7de2704e2d2a4","instance":[{"accessright":{"code":"c_16ec","label":"RESTRICTED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|issn___print::35ee75a5ad42581d604be113a8f56427","value":"New Phytologist"},"license":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/tdm_license_1.1","publicationdate":"2018-02-09","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Article","url":["https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1111%2Fnph.15014","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/nph.15014/fullpdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.15014"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|issn___print::35ee75a5ad42581d604be113a8f56427","value":"New Phytologist"},"refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Article","url":["https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/nph.15014"]},{"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|issn___print::35ee75a5ad42581d604be113a8f56427","value":"New Phytologist"},"refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Article","url":["https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.15014","https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/nph.15014","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.15014/abstract","https://aperto.unito.it/handle/2318/1660820","https://academic.microsoft.com/#/detail/2793208206"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_16ec","label":"RESTRICTED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|opendoar____::89fcd07f20b6785b92134bd6c1d0fa42","value":"Archivio Istituzionale"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|opendoar____::89fcd07f20b6785b92134bd6c1d0fa42","value":"Archivio Istituzionale"},"publicationdate":"2018-01-01","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Article","url":["http://hdl.handle.net/2318/1660820"]},{"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"publicationdate":"2018-12-01","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Other literature type","url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.15014"]}],"language":{"code":"und","label":"Undetermined"},"lastupdatetimestamp":1603727328518,"maintitle":"Native soils with their microbiotas elicit a state of alert in tomato plants","originalId":["10.1111/nph.15014","2793208206","oai:iris.unito.it:2318/1660820"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1111/nph.15014"},{"scheme":"pmid","value":"29424928"}],"projects":[{"acronym":"TomRes","code":"727929","funder":{"fundingStream":"H2020","jurisdiction":"EU","name":"European Commission","shortName":"EC"},"id":"40|corda__h2020::94c4a066401e22002c4811a301bb4655","provenance":{"provenance":"Harvested","trust":"0.900000000000000022"},"title":"A NOVEL AND INTEGRATED APPROACH TO INCREASE MULTIPLE AND COMBINED STRESS TOLERANCE IN PLANTS USING TOMATO AS A MODEL"}],"publicationdate":"2018-12-01","publisher":"Wiley","subjects":[{"subject":{"scheme":"keywords","value":"Plant Science"}},{"subject":{"scheme":"keywords","value":"Physiology"}},{"provenance":{"provenance":"Harvested","trust":"0.9"},"subject":{"scheme":"UNKNOWN","value":"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Defence responses; Lignin biosynthesis; Microbiota; Suppressive and conducive soils; Susceptible and resistant genotypes; Tomato; Physiology; Plant Science"}},{"provenance":{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.891"},"subject":{"scheme":"mesheuropmc","value":"food and beverages"}},{"provenance":{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.891"},"subject":{"scheme":"mesheuropmc","value":"fungi"}},{"provenance":{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8739"},"subject":{"scheme":"mesheuropmc","value":"complex mixtures"}}],"type":"publication"}

To this end, the main objective of this work is the prognosis of the mean, maximum and minimum hourly wind power (WP) 8hours ahead. For this purpose, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) modeling is applied. For the appropriate training of the developed ANN models hourly meteorological data are used. These data have been recorded by a meteorological mast in Tilos Island, Greece.\n\nFor the evaluation of the developed ANN forecasting models proper statistical evaluation indices are used. According to the results, the coefficient of the determination ranges from 0.285 up to 0.768 (mean hourly WP), from 0.227 up to 0.798 (maximum hourly WP) and from 0.025 up to 0.398 (minimum hourly WP). Furthermore, the proposed forecasting methodology shows that is able to give sufficient and adequate prognosis of WP by a wind turbine in a specific location 8 hours ahead. This will be a useful tool for the operator of a RES system in order to achieve a better monitoring and a better management of the whole system."],"format":[],"id":"50|dedup_wf_001::0a6525f420fd1f922125c3a1a280c8df","instance":[{"accessright":{"code":"c_16ec","label":"RESTRICTED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"publicationdate":"2017-02-23T20:11:53Z","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Conference object","url":["http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/conferences/10.1049/cp.2016.1094?crawler=true","http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/cp.2016.1094"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"license":"cc-by","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Conference object","url":["https://zenodo.org/record/887339/files/Wind%20power%20forecasting%20using%20historical%20data%20and%20artificial%20neural%20networks%20modeling.pdf"]},{"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Conference object","url":["http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/conferences/10.1049/cp.2016.1094","https://core.ac.uk/display/144851191","http://jglobal.jst.go.jp/public/20090422/201702260673071390","https://academic.microsoft.com/#/detail/2590295725"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|opendoar____::358aee4cc897452c00244351e4d91f69","value":"ZENODO"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|opendoar____::358aee4cc897452c00244351e4d91f69","value":"ZENODO"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","publicationdate":"2016-11-07","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Conference object","url":["https://zenodo.org/record/887339"]}],"language":{"code":"und","label":"Undetermined"},"lastupdatetimestamp":1603727328518,"maintitle":"Wind power forecasting using historical data and artificial neural networks modeling","originalId":["10.1049/cp.2016.1094","2590295725","oai:zenodo.org:887339"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1049/cp.2016.1094"}],"projects":[{"acronym":"TILOS","code":"646529","funder":{"fundingStream":"H2020","jurisdiction":"EU","name":"European Commission","shortName":"EC"},"id":"40|corda__h2020::64c901e621f90b9a38badb1d78902205","provenance":{"provenance":"Harvested","trust":"0.900000000000000022"},"title":"Technology Innovation for the Local Scale, Optimum Integration of Battery Energy Storage"}],"publicationdate":"2016-11-07","publisher":"Institution of Engineering and Technology","subjects":[{"provenance":{"provenance":"Harvested","trust":"0.9"},"subject":{"scheme":"keyword","value":"Wind Power, Forecasting, Artificial Neural Networks"}}],"type":"publication"}

This study focuses on estimating the evapotranspiration and crop coefficients of table grapes vineyards trained on overhead “tendone” systems in the Apulia region (Italy). Maximum vineyard transpiration was estimated by adopting the “direct” methodology for ETp proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization in Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56, with crop parameters estimated from Landsat 8 and RapidEye satellite data in combination with ground-based meteorological data. The modeling results of two growing seasons (2013 and 2014) indicated that canopy growth, seasonal and 10-day sums evapotranspiration values were strictly related to thermal requirements and rainfall events. The estimated values of mean seasonal daily evapotranspiration ranged between 4.2 and 4.1 mm·d−1, while midseason estimated values of crop coefficients ranged from 0.88 to 0.93 in 2013,  and 1.02 to 1.04 in 2014, respectively. The experimental evapotranspiration values calculated represent the maximum value in absence of stress, so the resulting crop coefficients should be used with some caution. It is concluded that the retrieval of crop parameters and evapotranspiration derived from remotely-sensed data could be helpful for downscaling to the field the local weather conditions and agronomic practices and thus may be the basis for supporting grape growers and irrigation managers."],"format":["application/pdf"],"id":"50|dedup_wf_001::0bc332de35b4eb0cc3d0c54b3ff22dd3","instance":[{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::a8db6f6b2ce4fe72e8b2314a9a93e7d9","value":"Sygma"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Article","url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs71114708"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|doajarticles::f7180a75ef642fcf5309759e0d2c431a","value":"Remote Sensing"},"license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","publicationdate":"2015-11-05","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Article","url":["http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/11/14708/pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs71114708"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|doajarticles::f7180a75ef642fcf5309759e0d2c431a","value":"Remote Sensing"},"license":"cc-by","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Article","url":["https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/11/14708/pdf"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|doajarticles::f7180a75ef642fcf5309759e0d2c431a","value":"Remote Sensing"},"refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Article","url":["https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/remotesensing/remotesensing7.html#VaninoPNMBD15","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs71114708","https://core.ac.uk/display/55147144","http://doi.org/10.3390/rs71114708","https://academic.microsoft.com/#/detail/2149946514"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|openaire____::c2cdfa5866e03cdd07d313cbc8fb8311","value":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|doajarticles::f7180a75ef642fcf5309759e0d2c431a","value":"Remote Sensing"},"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","publicationdate":"2015-11-05","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Other literature type","url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs71114708"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|driver______::bee53aa31dc2cbb538c10c2b65fa5824","value":"DOAJ-Articles"},"hostedby":{"key":"10|doajarticles::f7180a75ef642fcf5309759e0d2c431a","value":"Remote Sensing"},"publicationdate":"2015-11-01","refereed":"UNKNOWN","type":"Article","url":["http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/11/14708","https://doaj.org/toc/2072-4292"]},{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|opendoar____::d8c24ca8f23c562a5600876ca2a550ce","value":"Archivio della ricerca -

Vertical velocities can be estimated indirectly from in situ observations by theoretical frameworks like the-equation. Direct measures of vertical exchanges are challenging due to their typically ephemeral spatiotemporal scales. In this study we address this problem with an adaptive sampling strategy coupling various biophysical instruments. We analyze the 3-D organization of a cyclonic mesoscale structure finely sampled during the Observing Submesoscale Coupling At High Resolution cruise in the Ligurian Sea during fall 2015. The observations, acquired with a moving vessel profiler, highlight a subsurface low-salinity layer (≃50 m), as well as rising isopycnals, generated by geostrophic cyclonic circulation, in the structure's center. Reconstructed 3-D fields of density and horizontal velocities are used to estimate the vertical velocity field down to 250 m by applying the adiabatic QG-equation, for the first time in this region. The vertical motions are characterized by multipolar patterns of downward and upward velocities on the edges of the structure and significantly smaller vertical velocities in its center. Both the 3-D distribution of particles (size ≥100 μm), measured with a laser optical plankton counter, and the Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus abundances (cell per cubic meter) measured by flow cytometry are consistent with the 3-D velocity field. In particular, a secondary vertical recirculation is identified that upwells particles (from 250 to 100 m) along isohalines to the structure's center. Besides demonstrating the effect of vertical patterns on biogeochemical distributions, this case study suggests to use particle matter as a tracer to assess physical dynamics."],"format":["application/pdf"],"id":"50|dedup_wf_001::0d16b1714ab3077df73893a8ea57d776","instance":[{"accessright":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"collectedfrom":{"key":"10|opendoar____::7e7757b1e12abcb736ab9a754ffb617a","value":"Hyper
