are the fuel of any evolutionary process, and this also applies to carcinogenesis. The advent of affordable DNA sequencing has enabled mutagenic processes in the human soma to be quantified genome-wide, revealing a striking occurrence of hypermutated tumors. They exhibit an extreme load of somatic changes, often harbouring hundreds of single-nucleotide variants and/or indels per megabase. The HYPER-INSIGHT project is organized into three objectives, which aim to take advantage of the unique opportunity provided by genome sequences of hypermutated and ultramutated tumors. In particular, this work planned in this project aims to further our knowledge on (i) the regional organization of the DNA replication and repair program in human cells, and the determinants thereof, (ii) the extent of selection which acts on somatic variants in various pathways or complexes and (iii) opportunities for selectively targeting DNA repair deficiencies that manifest as hypermutation. Methodologically, our work will employ a three-pronged approach. First, we will perform a multitude of rigorous statistical analyses that draw on the rich and still-expanding resources provided by cancer genomics consortia. Second, we will perform exome and genome sequencing, focusing on ultramutated tumors caused by specific defects in the DNA maintenance machinery. Third, the project involves conditional essentiality screens on cancer cell lines with hypermutant backgrounds. Their goal is to discover synthetic lethality relationships, useful for targeting hypermutating cells, while sparing healthy ones. In summary, one of the promises of cancer genome sequencing projects was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying mutational processes in the human soma, advancing our understanding of this important facet of cancer biology. We will work towards realizing this promise, thereby strengthening the EU’s position in the global scientific endeavour."},"title":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":"Hypermutated tumors: insight into genome maintenance and cancer vulnerabilities provided by an extreme burden of somatic mutations"},"totalcost":1499810.0,"websiteurl":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":""}}

vital part of successful everyday social interaction is the ability to infer information about others (e.g. their emotions, visual perspective, and language). Development of these social skills (termed Theory of Mind, ToM) has been linked to improvements in more general cognitive skills, called Executive Functions (EF). However, to date very little is known of how this link varies with advancing age, and no model exists to explain the relationship. Thus, the key aim of the proposed research is to systematically explore the cognitive basis of social communication and how this changes across the life-span. The research will address three complementary objectives: (1) to what degree can variations in ToM ability across the life-span be accounted for by changes in EF skills, (2) how do ToM ability and EF skill change over time in different age groups (using longitudinal methods, i.e. test-retest of the same participants), and (3) can ToM ability be enhanced through training specific EF skills, and how do these training effects differ across the life-span. Contrary to traditional studies of social communication, I will employ an interdisciplinary approach that links theory and practice from cognitive, social, developmental, and clinical (neuro)psychology to study the relationship between ToM and EF across a broad and dynamic age range (10 to 80+ yrs old). I will use cutting-edge combinations of techniques (eye-tracking and EEG) and paradigms, alongside sophisticated statistical methods to track the timecourse of social understanding, and model how it relates to EF and more general cognitive/social skills (eg. IQ, language) within and between individuals. This research will open up new horizons in ToM research by developing an intervention programme to enhance the quality of social communication in older adults (thus improving their mental health and well-being), which has the potential to be applied in other individuals with social communication deficits (eg. autism)."},"title":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":"Tracking the cognitive basis of social communication across the life-span"},"totalcost":1488030.0,"websiteurl":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":""}}

countries are often plagued by civil wars. They are also, in many cases, emigration countries. Anybody interested in the development of such countries must understand to what extent these phenomena are interrelated, and how they interplay with each other. If it is pretty clear that civil wars push people to leave the country, it remains understudied how diasporas play a role in the emergence and evolution of violent conflicts.Indeed, the interactions between diasporas and conflict have roughly been overlooked by the economic literature to date, in spite of the very suggestive pieces of evidence provided by related research fields and of the very important policy questions that it raises – in particular, how to optimize the contribution of diasporas to peaceful development. Based on case studies such as those of Erytrea or of Sri Lanka, the literature in history and political science underlines diverse mechanisms through which diasporas have intervened in the evolution of violence in their home country, either as peace-builders or as peace-wreckers. On the other hand, in these case studies, the evolution of civil wars also appears to have been determinant of emigration and return migration patterns and, eventually, of the nature of diasporas’ involvement in the political situation in the homeland.This project will investigate the joint dynamics of civil conflicts and migration in developing countries. It will first build a theoretical framework to characterize how diasporas and civil wars interact together, accounting for the endogeneity of both migration and violence. The theoretical predictions derived from this framework will then be empirically tested, relying on recent and original data. Through a multi-disciplinary perspective, nourished by the findings of the qualitative research and relying on economic tools – both theoretical and empirical – this project will allow to build the first comprehensive investigation of the diasporas – conflict nexus."},"title":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":"Investigating the interactions between civil wars and migration."},"totalcost":160800.0,"websiteurl":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":""}}

EU has to face many challenges in achieving a more balanced regional development and sustainable economic recovery. Many of those challenges have to do with the ageing population trend, urbanization and environment under distress. More liveable and efficient communities is a target to be reached in Europe, where the “silver hair” trends can become a challenging opportunity, from a social, economic and cultural perspective. Despite those challenges are strongly interlinked, solutions provided in urban contexts not often pay due attention to the social process underlying urban trends and to the needs and behaviour of elderly citizens. GRAGE intends to contribute to fill this gap, developing winning ideas to promote an active, harmonious and inclusive citizenship for elderly people living in urban contexts. The consortium gathers ground-breaking expertise from different scientific background (legal, economic, humanities, engineering), from academic and non academic institutions, belonging to several countries (from EU and Ukraine). Using a mix of methodologies, the research and innovation programme of the project will evolve around the idea of citizenship as a collector of interest, healthy environment and suitable urban solutions for an aging society. Main themes will be: green buildings, food and urban agriculture, information and language technology. Researcher will analyze their role in transforming cities in environments that support green and healthy lifestyles for elderly people. GRAGE intents to boost dialogue through Europe, both strengthening the academic and non-academic collaboration and a practical understanding of elderly living across Europe. Such a cooperation can have a series of returns for Europe, ranging from a more effective solution to strategic challenges (sustainable cities and demographic change) to new business opportunities for European firms, offering solutions and products for smart/inclusive/ageing societies at global level."},"title":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":"Grey and green in Europe: elderly living in urban areas"},"totalcost":828000.0,"websiteurl":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":""}}

towards the development of sustainable energy sources focusses on minimising our negative impact on the Earth. Towards this end investigations into the exploitation of solar power as a clean source of energy are active across multiple scientific disciplines. One approach is to utilise water splitting catalysts to generate oxygen and combustible hydrogen gas from water. This task is often split into the two halves of the problem: the oxygen evolving and hydrogen evolving sides.This project aims at the development of a new class of hydrogen evolving catalysts based on mechanically interlocked rotaxane architectures. The advantages of the proposed catalysts include mechanical protection of the catalytic centre, prevention of ligand dissociation by virtue of mechanical bonding, and assembly of the multi-component architecture in a single, rapid, high-yielding step.Initially rotaxane ligands will be synthesised using the synthetically flexible, convergent, active template (AT) methodology followed by examination of their coordination chemistry with abundant and cheap cobalt. Subsequently these structures will be assessed for their catalytic behaviour using electrochemical techniques, with structural optimisation utilised to improve their activity. We will then append photosensitising units to imbue these systems with photocatalytic activity.This MSCA would allow me to develop my skills as an independent scientist, both in terms of capitalising on the skill set during my studies in New Zealand, combined with gaining new knowledge and practical abilities, as well as enhancing my supervisory, teaching, and project management skills. Furthermore, having obtained my tertiary education (including Ph.D.) overseas, the action would facilitate my reintegration into the European scientific community and provide Europe with a highly skilled, independent scientist ready to take up the challenge of an independent research position."},"title":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":"Click to Lock: Mechanically Interlocked Architectures as Hydrogen Evolving Catalysts"},"totalcost":183455.0,"websiteurl":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":""}}

proposal seeks funding under the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2014-2015 to establish an ERA-NET for joint European research coordination on Sustainable Animal Production (SusAn). The scope for this ERA-NET has been developed under the SCAR Collaborative Working Group on Sustainable Animal Production (CWG-SAP). Funding organisations from 22 European countries initially seek to support one co-funded call followed by other joint activities including the development of a Common Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda on Sustainable Animal Production. The animal production sector forms an important part of Europe’s (agricultural) economy and plays an essential role in the provision of Europe`s citizens with high quality animal products. Like other agriculture sectors, animal production faces many challenges from projected increases in global demand for food, climate change, competition for natural resources and economic volatility. The European animal production landscape is very complex, consisting of different species farmed within a wide range of different extensive, semi-intensive and intensive production systems using multiple resources to produce a diverse range of animal products and other services. Partners in this ERA-NET believe, however, that these challenges and complexities can be effectively addressed through joint European research within a framework which supports the three pillars of sustainability - economy, environment and society - and targets opportunities for innovative research spanning all areas of animal production such as health and welfare, feeding and nutrition, reproduction, breeding and genetics, housing, nutrient management and economics. Partners in ERA-NET SusAn endorse scientific excellence and recommend an integrated, interdisciplinary, cross-cutting and multi-actor approach to research and knowledge exchange which reflects the complexity of the research requirements for sustainable European animal production."},"title":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":"European Research Area on Sustainable Animal Production Systems"},"totalcost":1.59838E7,"websiteurl":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":""}}

riparian forests that flank the major rivers in the Amazon Basin form a highly distinct ecosystem that connects the most biodiverse aquatic and terrestrial environments on the planet. These ‘flood forests’ are inundated for periods of up to six months each year. But although submerged part of the year, flood forests are susceptible to forest fires during the dry season, especially in El Niño (ENSO) drought years. Surprisingly, flood forests poorly regenerate after burning, and after repeated burning can transition to a savanna-like state in which the forest appears unable to regenerate altogether. Our previous field surveys and experiments suggest that seed dispersal limitations may play a fundamental role in understanding the resilience of flood forests to fire perturbations. Fire destroys the seed bank completely. We hypothesise that forest regeneration is arrested by limited seed dispersal as burnt treeless stands affect fish communities and the capacity to retain incoming seeds. Amazonian fishes heavily exploit flood forests during the rainy season. Most flood forest trees produce fruits and seeds during the time of high water, coinciding with the arrival of fishes. Fishes may play an important role as dispersal agents for flood forest trees, as tree seeds have been found in the stomachs of >200 fish species. The reduced input of seeds in burned areas suggests that fishes avoid entering these sites, resulting in a positive feedback that helps to keep these areas in a state of sparse tree cover. In the proposed research, we will assess the ecological barriers that explain arrested regeneration of Amazonian flood forests by evaluating the pathways of seed dispersal and the effects of fire on the composition and abundance of fish communities. Understanding the regeneration of flood forests after fire will become increasingly relevant as extreme ENSO drought events and their associated fires are predicted to become more frequent."},"title":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":"Understanding the resilience of Amazonian floodplain ecosystems"},"totalcost":171461.0,"websiteurl":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":""}}

research in the field of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has greatly advanced over the last decades, driven by the potential of OLED technology for various display applications. Yet, today, most of the commercial OLED devices contain expensive rare metals like Iridium and Platinum. An alternative promising strategy is based on the use of all-organic emitters, featuring the recently reported thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) mechanism. Relying on a reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process, TADF-based OLEDs may utilize all electrically generated singlet and triplet excitons, going well beyond the 25% spin statistical bottleneck of organic electroluminescence. Nowadays, however, only a few TADF-based OLEDs have demonstrated efficiencies comparable to the best metal-organic materials. Research efforts so far have been mostly based on a trial-and-error approach in absence of a solid fundamental understanding of the underlying processes. The project MILORD aims at providing a comprehensive picture of the TADF mechanism through the use of an original multiscale modelling approach, going all the way from the molecular to the device scale. We will explore the energetics and nature of the involved excited states, describe the kinetics of competing processes, and model the diffusion and interactions of singlets and triplets in a realistic medium. The results of MILORD will provide detailed mechanistic insights into the TADF process, which will ultimately allow us to identify structure-property relationships and propose new strategies to minimize losses. By integrating the research into a large collaborative network around the Host and the Fellow, we hope that our theoretical work will guide synthetic efforts towards the discovery of a new generation of more efficient materials and device architectures."},"title":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":"Managing trIplets for fLuorescence in ORganics: Towards a predictive moDel (MILORD)"},"totalcost":172800.0,"websiteurl":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":""}}
